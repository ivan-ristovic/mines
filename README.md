# Minesweeper

Coded in C# using Visual Studio 2017 RC.

## Game rules:
1. Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
2. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.
3. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squares â€” information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

## Installation
For now the only way to actually run the program is to download the project and import it into your Visual Studio.

When I finish, I will add an installer or something.
