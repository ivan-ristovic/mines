# :sparkles: Minesweeper :sparkles:

![ss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-ristovic/mines/master/screenshots/2017-03-17.PNG)

Coded in C# using Visual Studio 2017 RC.

## :page_facing_up: Game rules:
1. Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
2. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.
3. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squares â€” information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

## :computer: Installation
For now the only way to actually run the program is to download the project and import it into your Visual Studio.

When I finish, I will add an installer or something.
